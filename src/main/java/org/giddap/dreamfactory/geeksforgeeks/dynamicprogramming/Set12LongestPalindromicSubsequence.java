 * Given a sequence, find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in it. For example, if the given
 * sequence is “BBABCBCAB”, then the output should be 7 as “BABCBAB” is the longest palindromic subseuqnce in it.
 * “BBBBB” and “BBCBB” are also palindromic subsequences of the given sequence, but not the longest ones.
