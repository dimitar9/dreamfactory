 * <a href="http://oj.leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/">Valid Palindrome</a>
 * <p/>
 * Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
 * <pre>
 * For example,
 * "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.
 * "race a car" is not a palindrome.
 * </pre>
 * Note:
 * Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.
